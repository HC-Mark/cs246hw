Assignment 5 reflections.

Please answer the questions below:

1. How did this assignment go for you? (Please write several sentences.)

This assignment went well! It was a good introduction to pointers and I have never quite been able to grasp pointers but I think this class is really going to help. I can see myself getting the hang of them now! I also am more confident with Makefiles now. 
	
2. What was hard about this assignment?

I actually found the overlap question confusing at first until I thought of it as two ranges of numbers overlapping. It also took a bit of thought to figure out how to check for rows, colums, and the two diagonals.  I can already see the benefit of pointers because compared to the amount of code I have for my 15 puzzle, this is a lot less. 

3. What would you like to know more about?

Just more pointer practice! 

4. How long did this assignment take you? (Do not include time spent on the readings.)

This assignment was really quick for me. It took less than two hours, not including the readings. I did spend extra time reviewing and doing the lab work before attempting the homework assignment.
