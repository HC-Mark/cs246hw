Assignment 5 reflections.

Please answer the questions below:

1. How did this assignment go for you? (Please write several sentences.)
  This assignment is very easy for me. Before doing the assignment, I reviewed the chapter 12 and 11 of textbook and it helps me a lot. The assignment helps me have a clearer understanding of pointer.

2. What was hard about this assignment?
  I have to admit that minisort toke me longest. I tried to do some fancy loops to avoid pattern matching ( well, I know it is a Haskell term but I really think it is suitable to be used here.), but failed. So I tried to do pattern matching and it worked. 
3. What would you like to know more about?
   In my understanding of pointer, it is an address of another stuff in computer. Besides array, I think pointer must have its own advantage when we use it. But I did not see that much in this assignment, I really want to know how pointer help computer increase its efficiency.
4. What resources (other than our book) did you use (e.g., website links)?
  Textbook, chapter 12 and chapter 11. Chapter 12 is especailly helpful.
5. What collaborators did you work with to discuss the problems?
  Delyan and Eileen.
6. How long did this assignment take you? (Do not include time spent on the readings.)
  About one and a half hours.
